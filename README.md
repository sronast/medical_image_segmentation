Official pytorch implementation of the paper **[Histogram of Oriented Gradients Meet Deep Learning: A Novel Multi-task Deep Network for Medical Image Semantic Segmentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523000087?via%3Dihub)** \
This work presents a novel deep multi-task learning method for medical image segmentation leveraging Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOGs) to generate pseudo-labels.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 1.8
- CUDA 10.1

# Installation

First of all, clone the repo:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thetna/medical_image_segmentation.git
```
All the required python packages can be installed with:
```bash
    cd medical_image_segmentation
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Training

For training, first put training images and corresponding segmentation maps in separate directories and update the following information in the `Config/train.yml` file.

```
config/train.yml
├──  network    - Segmentation achitectures: UNet, UNet+HOG, U2Net, U2Net+HOG
│
├──  dataset    - Specify the datasets to use for training: Cadis, Robinst, Custom
│ 
├──  task       - Task number for Cadis or Robinst datasets: 1, 2, 3
│ 
├──  datasets 
│    └── train  - Training data configurations
│    └── valid  - Validation data configurations
│ 
├──  seg_net 
│    └── in_nc  - Input number of channels
│    └── out_nc - Output number of channels or total number of classes 
│    └── resume_path  - Path for checkpoint to resume from
│ 
├──  hog_decoder 
│    └── out_dim  - Dimension of HOG to use
│    └── resume_path  - Path for checkpoint to resume from
│
├──  train    - All other training parameters
```

Then start training with the following command:

```bash
    python train.py config/train.yml
```

# Inference

Download the pre-trained weights from [here](). Add the path of images and the models in the `config/test.yml`. Then run the following command:
```bash
    python test.py config/test.yml
```

# Results
